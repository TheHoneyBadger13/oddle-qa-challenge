#Issue experiencing

Stuck on processing after clicking 'COMPLETE' button in 3D secure 2 (has no issue with payment when testing non 3D secure payment, there is also a test for that in the spec file). Not sure if it is a card no. issue but I found a card number that needs 3D secure 2 and it works (included in another test scenarios)

Cypress test runner disappears when redirecting to stripe checkout page. used 'experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode' and 'chromeWebSecurity' as work-around


#note

Added a handler for email OTP because I thought that the email otp for 1-click checkout needs a valid OTP(already made the handler when i realized that the site accepts any input). I also included it on the spec file (just placed it inside comments), handler file is also included
