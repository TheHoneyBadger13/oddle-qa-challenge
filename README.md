#Issue experiencing

Stuck on processing after clicking 'COMPLETE' button in 3D secure 2 (has no issue with payment when testing non 3D secure payment, there is also a test for that in the spec file). Not sure if it is a card no. issue but I found a card number that needs 3D secure 2 and it works (included in another test scenarios)

Cypress test runner disappears when redirecting to stripe checkout page. used 'experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode' and 'chromeWebSecurity' as work-around
